               <p class="testimonial-text">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've suceesfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

               <h2 class="testimonial-heading">such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended</h2>
               <p class="testimonial-text">"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
